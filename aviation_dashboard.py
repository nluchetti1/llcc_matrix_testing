# The pipeline got longer when the PSU BUFKIT stage was slowed to 2 concurrent connections,
# and longer again on an ECMWF ENS / GEFS cycle change. Without this, a run that overruns the
# hour has a second run pushing to main underneath it — which is the race the `git pull
# --rebase` at the bottom was papering over. cancel-in-progress stays false so a run that is
# mid-fetch is never killed partway through writing history.json.

    # Default is 6 hours. A hung fetch on a dead endpoint would otherwise burn Actions
    # minutes until someone noticed; a normal run is well under 20 minutes even on a
    # cycle change, so 60 is generous without being open-ended.
