ivt_maps.py — CW3E-style spatial Integrated Vapor Transport maps.

Companion to ivt.py. That module does the column integral for the point/matrix
values; this one does the 2D field: fetch, integrate on the grid, render, and hand
back a {model: {fh_key: png_path}} dict for history.json.

WHAT THE PROBES ESTABLISHED (2026-08-31, verified live -- do not re-derive):

  * NOMADS GRIB filter with `subregion` beats S3 byte-range by ~32x for this job.
    GFS SPFH+U+V over the wide domain is 1.5 MB/step against 48.4 MB/step pulling
    whole global messages off S3. Server-side subsetting wins because IVT needs many
    levels over a small footprint.

  * GFS serves SPFH on all 17 integration levels. Use it directly.

  * RAP and NAM DO NOT serve SPFH through the filter. They return HTTP 200 with
    valid GRIB containing u and v and NO moisture at all -- which would integrate to
    IVT ~= 0 and read as a bone-dry airmass. Both carry RH+TMP on all 17 levels, so
    they go through the RH route. This is why _grid_moisture() refuses to guess:
    a missing moisture field must raise, never silently yield zeros.

  * HRRR is NOT reachable here. filter_hrrr_sub.pl is the SUB-HOURLY filter and
    rejects wrfprs filenames outright ("Filename does not match legal pattern:
    hrrr.t..z.wrfsubhf...grib2$"). HRRR would have to come from HRRR_AWS_ROOT with
    no spatial subsetting. Since IVT is synoptic and HRRR tops out at 48 h, it is
    deliberately excluded rather than paid for.

  * ECMWF open data has q but NO subsetting -- ~16 MB/step global vs GFS's 1.5 MB.
    Left out of the default set; ECMWF_ENABLED below turns it on if wanted.
