ivt.py — Integrated Vapor Transport for the Cape Canaveral aviation dashboard.

Self-contained. Imports nothing from aviation_dashboard.py, so it can be unit-tested
in isolation and dropped in without touching the import graph.

    IVT = (1/g) * | integral_{p_top}^{p_sfc} q * V dp |      [kg m^-1 s^-1]

Two entry points:

    column_ivt(layers, ...)      -> dict, or None if the column can't support the integral
    ivt_from_profile(hour_dict)  -> same, reading the `_layers` that
                                    compute_profile_variables() already returns

Because every profile in the pipeline already carries pres / tmpc / dwpt / rh / u / v,
this runs on GFS, RAP, HRRR (BUFKIT and NOMADS pad columns), ECMWF HRES, RRFS, REFS,
GEFS members and ECMWF ENS members with no additional network fetching.

UNITS, which is where this goes wrong silently:
  * layers["pres"]  hPa
  * layers["u"],["v"]  KNOTS. Both producers agree on this -- parse_time_series_bufkit
    derives them from SKNT, and _grib_levels_to_layers multiplies the GRIB m/s by
    1.943844 on ingest. Feeding knots into the integral unconverted inflates IVT by
    exactly 1.9438x, which lands values in a range that still looks physical.
  * layers["dwpt"],["tmpc"]  degrees C
  * output IVT  kg m^-1 s^-1
